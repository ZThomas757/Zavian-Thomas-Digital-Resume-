        My job experience mainly involves working at Grand Gulf Nuclear Station 
        in Port Gibson, MS. I had two internships there during the summer of 2023
        and 2024. My main tasks were to shadow and help plant engineers with daily
        tasks, and I had to learn about different functions of the plant. 
        I was a part of the Component Maintenance Support group where I learned about 
        different predictive maintenance technologies, and I helped other groups like 
        Systems Electrical with various walkdowns and inspection tasks.
